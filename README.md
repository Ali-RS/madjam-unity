# Madjam Unity
Meeting of the Minds

## Core Principals
You are an alien blob trying to seek the overblob. Hop between different types of bizarre alien species to take over their mind and progress to the finish
To swap between animals, you must bring your currently possessed animal within range. Then you can hop between the two.

## Control Considerations
* Two button + directional movement
* Button 1 - Perform action
* Button 2 - Swap bodies

## Theme
* Alien jungle
* Earth like animals, but with a twist
* High contrast, high saturation, colourful scenery
* Dark, damp, but colourful, strange and wonderful

## Animal Mechanics
**Flying/flapping**
* Possess a flying creature to flap around, avoiding obstacles and navigating tight spaces. 

**Rushing/Charging**
* Charge forward and smash through obstacles. Look out for pits and traps

**Climbing/Clinging**
* Cling to walls and roofs to navigate difficult terrain. You can drop off terrain, but be careful not to fall into any traps. While clinging, you follow the surface you are on.

## Environmental Hazards (WIP/need to flush out more)
* Spikes (walls, roof, floor)
* Pits (drop to your doom)
* Moving platforms (crushing/timing) (constantly moving/activated)
* Brambles (Like spikes, but only affects flying)
* Boulders/hard bricks (can only be smashed through)
* Slippery walls (spider cant cling)

## Mobile Considerations
* Tap the animal to swap instead of having a dedicated button for swapping
* Left half of the screen is a reactive/responsive virtual d-pad. ie. it will register your initial tap as the 0,0 origin so you are disoriented. 
* Second (right) half of the screen would be a giant touch zone for your action button
